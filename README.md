# Unix-style command line options parser

This is a minimalistic parser of command line options. I wrote it because I
find [Unix Options](https://github.com/astine/unix-options)' concept flawed
and its implementation too hairy.

Main advantage of this library is ability to concisely define command line
options once and then use this definition for parsing and extraction of
command line arguments, as well as printing description of command line
options (you get `--help` for free). This way you don't need to repeat
yourself. Unlike Unix-Options, this library doesn't provide any flashy
macros with weird logic.

## Installation

Copy files of this library in any place where ASDF can find them. Then you
can use it in system definitions and ASDF will take care of the rest.

## Description

... coming soon (as soon as I finish it!)
